# Mnielsen's "Neural Networks and Deep Learning" Live

An adaptation of nielsen's code so that after the training the user can check if custom images can be identified.

This was a college assignment of mine. The adapted code can be found in the "src" folder and some test images at "src/samples".


All credits to [Michael Nielsen](https://github.com/mnielsen/neural-networks-and-deep-learning) and his amazing book. I merely changed how the program is given the MNIST data set and added a few functions to parse the images. Beware that the images resolutions must be 28x28. Commented code at "src/run.py"
